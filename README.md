## <a id="tldr"></a>TL;DR
This is one of my hobby projects and I wanted to try something challenging and new. Working with videos and pictures is quite new to me, so this project is a way to learn and experiment with these technologies.

Video-Picture Diary is a simple app for creating short, personalized videos from your photos. Capture or upload pictures, add titles or descriptions, and quickly turn your collection into engaging video slideshows. Whether you're documenting daily moments, making slideshows for friends, or organizing memories, this app streamlines the process of sharing your visual stories.
